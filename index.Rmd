# AHA & TCU meeting: October 11, 2013

## Core research questions

-- What is the geography of cardiovascular disease in Texas?


-- How can we make sense of geographic inequities in cardiovascular disease?


-- What social and environmental factors are influencing health outcomes?






**Methods of analysis to this point: data visualization and exploratory data analysis**

---

## Data sources

-- Hospital discharge data obtained from Texas DSHS for 2006

-- Hospitalization cases with ICD-9-CM codes pertaining to heart-related ailment diagnoses retained

-- Cases aggregated to the level of the zip code; age-adjusted rates calculated for each zip code

## Analysis for Scientific Sessions

-- Goal: to determine what types of communities are experiencing high hospitalization rates

-- Methods: classification analysis of top quarter of zip codes based on demographic characteristics 

-- Based on this analysis, we identified four community "types" experiencing high rates of cardiovascular disease hospitalizations:

  1. Diverse communities on the fringes of major metropolitan areas;
  2. Urban-core neighborhoods with a majority African-American population;
  3. Largely white zip codes in rural Texas;
  4. Majority-Hispanic communities, located both in and around major cities and in the Rio Grande Valley

## Next steps

-- Multivariate analysis of which social and environmental factors influence the prevalence of heart disease

-- Collaboration, research, and program development with you!
